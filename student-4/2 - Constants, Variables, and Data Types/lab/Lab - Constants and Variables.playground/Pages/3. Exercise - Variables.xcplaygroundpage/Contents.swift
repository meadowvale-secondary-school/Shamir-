 ## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
var schooling =  11

/*:
 Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
schooling = 12
print(schooling)
/*:
 Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
 */
print("The above code complies since rather than it being a constant which has a fixed value, it is a variable. A variable can have it value changed over the course of the program thus allowing the above code to compile.")

/*:
 ## Exercise - Constants

 Declare a constant called `friends` to represent the number of friends you have on social media. Give it a value between 50 and 1000. Print out the value by referencing your constant.
 */
let friends = 70
print(friends)

/*:
 Now assume you go through and remove friends that aren't active on social media. Attempt to update your `friends` constant to a lower number than it currently is. Observe what happens and then move to the next step.
 */


/*:
 Does the above code compile? Why not? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function. Go back and delete your line of code that updates the `friends` constant to a lower number so that the playground will compile properly.
 */
print("Since friends is a constanst and the complier thinks of it as a fixed value that cannot be altered. So when decreasing the friends constant value, you alter it which cannot be turn in a constant but can be done in a variable.")

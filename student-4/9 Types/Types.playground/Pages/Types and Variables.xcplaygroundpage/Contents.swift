/*: 
 You’ll see an error that says `Cannot assign value of type 'Int' to type 'String'`. This is important: The _value_ of a variable can change, but the _type_ of the variable can’t change.
 
 This rule helps you to avoid mistakes and confusion in your code. 
 
 - callout(Exercise): Update the line above with the error so that the variable can be updated. How do you write a `String` instead of an `Int`? 
 
 Next, learn other ways Swift protects you when working with types.
